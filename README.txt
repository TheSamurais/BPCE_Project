To run functionality implemented in the project, open BP_ActorWithout.

This project contains two EditorModules BPCompilerExtensionEditorModule and BPCompilerExtensionEditorModuleSimple. They do the same but one was created and added to the project in a way Samurais would implement it, and a second is simplified version created for post about BlueprintCompilerExtension. At the end of the post you can find overview of more complex implementation.

By default both modules are added to project, but if you want to have only one active remove the other from .uproject file.
