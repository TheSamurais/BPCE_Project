To run functionality implemented in the project, open Content/BCE_Files/BP_ActorWithoutSM and check Compiler Results.


This project contains two EditorModules BPCompilerExtensionEditorModule and BPCompilerExtensionEditorModuleSimple. They do the same but one was created and added to the project in a way Samurais would implement it, and a second is simplified version created for post about BlueprintCompilerExtension. At the end of the post you can find brief overview of more complex implementation.

By default both modules are enabled in project, but if you want to have only one active remove the other from .uproject file.
